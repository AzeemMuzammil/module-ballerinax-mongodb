# ConnectionProperties type represents the properties which are used to configure MongoDB connection.
#
# + url - The complete MongoDB connection URL. If this is provided, this will be directly used connect to the database
#   instead of any provided host/port/username/password information. You still need to provide the `dbName` property
# + readConcern - Controls the consistency and isolation properties of the data read from replica sets and replica set
#   shards
# + writeConcern - Describes the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for write operations to a standalone
#   mongod or to replica sets or to sharded clusters
# + readPreference - Describes how MongoDB clients route read operations to the members of a replica set
# + authSource - The database name associated with the userâ€™s credentials.
# + authMechanism - The authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to authenticate the connection
# + gssapiServiceName - Sets the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized MongoDB instances
# + sslEnabled - Whether to connect using SSL
# + sslInvalidHostNameAllowed - Whether to allow invalid host names for SSL connections
# + socketTimeout - How long a send or receive on a socket can take before timing out
# + connectionTimeout - How long a connection can take to be opened before timing out
# + maxPoolSize - The maximum number of connections in the connection pool
# + minPoolSize - The minimum number of connections in the connection pool
# + waitQueueMultiple - This multiplier, multiplied with the maxPoolSize setting, gives the maximum number of
#   waiting connection requests. All further requests will get an error right away
# + waitQueueTimeout - The maximum wait time in milliseconds to wait for a connection to
#   become available
# + localThreshold - When choosing among multiple MongoDB servers to send a request, the driver will only
#   send that request to a server whose ping time is less than or equal to the server with the fastest ping time plus the local
#   threshold
# + heartbeatFrequency - The frequency that the driver will attempt to determine the current state of each server in the
#   cluster
# + replicaSet - Implies that the hosts given are a seed list, and the driver will attempt to find all members of the
#   set
# + retryWrites - If true write operations will be retried if they fail due to a network error
